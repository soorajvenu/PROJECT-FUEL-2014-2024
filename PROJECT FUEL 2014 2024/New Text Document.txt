Project Title: Election Impact Analysis on Petroleum Products in Kerala
1. Introduction
Objective: Analyze the impact of elections (Lok Sabha and Kerala Legislative Assembly) on petrol and diesel prices.
Elections Covered:
Lok Sabha: 2014, 2019, 2024
Kerala Legislative Assembly: 2016, 2021
Duration: 45 days before and after each election.
Dataset: Petroleum product prices in Kerala on a weekly basis.
2. Data Collection
Sources: List the reputable sources from which you have sourced the daily price data.
Dataset Structure:
Describe the columns of the rates.csv file (e.g., Date, Petrol Price, Diesel Price).
Provide sample rows to demonstrate how the data is structured.
3. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning the Data:
Handling missing values or irregularities in price data.
Transformation:
Aggregating data on a weekly basis if necessary.
Explain any transformations made to the data (e.g., converting date formats, calculating percentage changes).
4. Dynamic Data Visualizations
Tools: Python libraries (e.g., Plotly, Matplotlib).
Interactive Visualizations:
Include images or snapshots of the interactive visualizations.
Explain the insights derived from each chart (e.g., price trends before and after elections).
5. Dashboard Design
Tool Used: Power BI or Tableau.
Design and Features:
Briefly describe the dashboard layout and key elements (charts, filters, etc.).
Provide screenshots and insights from the dashboard.
6. Time Series Analysis
Objective: Analyze trends over time and the impact of elections.
Modeling Techniques:
Implement machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA) for time series prediction.
Share performance metrics (F1 score, accuracy, etc.).
Insights:
Include charts and graphs showing the forecasted trends and actual price data.
Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
7. Predictive Modeling
Objective: Predict future price trends of petroleum products.
Approach:
Describe the machine learning models used (e.g., linear regression, random forest).
Show performance metrics and compare models.
Results:
Present the prediction results with charts (predicted vs actual).
Highlight any significant election-related changes.
8. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
Integration Process:
Explain how the machine learning model is integrated with a CI/CD pipeline.
Mention tools used (e.g., Jenkins, Docker).
Deployment:
Describe the deployment process and automated model updates.
9. Conclusion
Key Findings: Summarize the main findings of the analysis.
Election Impact: Conclude how elections influenced petroleum prices.
Future Work: Mention potential improvements or areas for further research.
10. References
List all data sources, research papers, and libraries used.
Additional Notes:

Charts: Include static images of dynamic visualizations, time series plots, dashboard snapshots, and any relevant visual aids.
Formatting: Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to make the document clear and readable.
Appendices: Consider adding an appendix for code snippets, detailed metrics, or large visualizations.
This outline can serve as a foundation for your documentation. You can expand each section as you complete the analysis and generate insights
